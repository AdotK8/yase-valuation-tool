        <strong>Property Data API</strong>: The widget utilizes the Property Data API to provide clients with quick and accurate estimates for sale and rental values. 
    </li> 
    <li> 
        <strong>Email Endpoints</strong>: After the valuation is retrieved, an email is automatically sent to the client with the information. A notification email is also dispatched to the Yase Property team, enabling sales consultants to follow up with the client. Nodemailer is used for this functionality.

    <li> 
        <strong>Frontend Design</strong>: The widget features a responsive layout optimized for mobile devices, as many clients access it via ads on various social media platforms. The design seamlessly integrates with the overall aesthetic of the website and is embedded into the Wix site using iframes.
